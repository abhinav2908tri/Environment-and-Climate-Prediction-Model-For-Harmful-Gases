1. Data Collection: The first stage involves data collection from reliable sources such as:

https://www.statista.com/statistics/606019/co2-emissions-india/

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/co2-data/master/owid-co2-data.csv

This includes information on CO, emissions, energy consumption, economic indicators, and climate variables.

2. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning: The collected data is then preprocessed and cleaned to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Techniques such as mean imputation, interpolation, and standardization are used to make the data suitable for analysis.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Once the data is prepared, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted to identify trends, seasonality, and relationships between different factors affecting emissions. Visualization techniques like rolling mean plots, decomposition, and heatmaps help in understanding patterns.

4. Model Selection & Implementation: Based on these insights, the project moves to the model selection phase, where various forecasting techniques are applied. Traditional time-series models like ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) are used to capture historical trends and seasonal variations. Additionally, deep learning models like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks) are employed to

5. Model Evaluation: The models are trained and evaluated using historical data, with an 80-20 train- test split and cross-validation to ensure robustness. Performance is assessed using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

6. Deployment & Visualization: The best-performing model is then deployed as a real-time forecasting API, allowing users to input parameters (e.g., year, sector) and receive CO, emission predictions. The model is deployed on cloud platforms like AWS or Google Cloud, ensuring scalability and accessibility. Additionally, an automated system updates the model with new data, continuously retraining it to improve accuracy.

7. Continuous Monitoring & Updates: The automated system updates the model with new data, continuously retraining it to improveÂ accuracy.
