# Environment-and-Climate-Prediction-Model-For-Harmful-Gases
Introduction
Carbon emissions have become a significant environmental concern globally, and India, as one of the fastest- growing economies, plays a crucial role in this issue. The country's rapid industrialization, urbanization, and energy consumption have led to a steady rise in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH), and carbon monoxide (CO). These emissions contribute to climate change, air pollution, and ecological imbalances, affecting both human health and natural ecosystems.

Understanding the historical trends and regional variations of carbon emissions in India is essential for developing effective mitigation strategies. By analyzing historical data, we can identify patterns that provide insights into the sources and intensity of emissions across different regions. Such an analysis can help policymakers, environmental organizations, and researchers develop data-driven approaches to reduce emissions and promote sustainability.

This project focuses on examining India's carbon emissions over time, exploring regional disparities, and highlighting key factors influencing these trends. Through a comprehensive study of emission data, we aim to provide a foundation for informed decision-making and future initiatives aimed at curbing emissions and fostering a greener, more sustainableÂ future.
